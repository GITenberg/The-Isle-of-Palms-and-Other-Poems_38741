<h2>CANTO FIRST.</h2>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It is the midnight hour:&mdash;the beauteous Sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Calm as the cloudless heaven, the heaven discloses,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While many a sparkling star, in quiet glee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far down within the watery sky reposes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if the Ocean's heart were stirr'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With inward life, a sound is heard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like that of dreamer murmuring in his sleep;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis partly the billow, and partly the air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That lies like a garment floating fair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above the happy Deep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sea, I ween, cannot be fann'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By evening freshness from the land,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
<span class="i0">For the land it is far away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But God hath will'd that the sky-born breeze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the centre of the loneliest seas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should ever sport and play.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mighty Moon she sits above,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Encircled with a zone of love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A zone of dim and tender light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That makes her wakeful eye more bright:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She seems to shine with a sunny ray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the night looks like a mellow'd day!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gracious Mistress of the Main<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath now an undisturbed reign,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from her silent throne looks down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As upon children of her own,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the waves that lend their gentle breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In gladness for her couch of rest!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">My spirit sleeps amid the calm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sleep of a new delight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hopes that she ne'er may awake again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But for ever hang o'er the lovely main,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And adore the lovely night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scarce conscious of an earthly frame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She glides away like a lambent flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in her bliss she sings;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now touching softly the Ocean's breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now mid the stars she lies at rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if she sail'd on wings!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now bold as the brightest star that glows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More brightly since at first it rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looks down on the far-off flood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there all breathless and alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the sky where she soars were a world of her own,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She mocketh the gentle Mighty One<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he lies in his quiet mood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Art thou," she breathes, "the Tyrant grim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That scoffs at human prayers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Answering with prouder roaring the while,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As it rises from some lonely isle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through groans raised wild, the hopeless hymn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of shipwreck'd mariners?<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! Thou art harmless as a child<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Weary with joy, and reconciled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For sleep to change its play;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now that night hath stay'd thy race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smiles wander o'er thy placid face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if thy dreams were gay."&mdash;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">And can it be that for me alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Main and Heavens are spread?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! whither, in this holy hour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have those fair creatures fled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To whom the ocean-plains are given<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As clouds possess their native heaven?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tiniest boat, that ever sail'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon an inland lake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might through this sea without a fear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her silent journey take,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though the helmsman slept as if on land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the oar had dropp'd from the rower's hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How like a monarch would she glide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the husht billow kiss'd her side<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
<span class="i0">With low and lulling tone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some stately Ship, that from afar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shone sudden, like a rising star,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all her bravery on!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">List! how in murmurs of delight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blessed airs of Heaven invite<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The joyous bark to pass one night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within their still domain!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O grief! that yonder gentle Moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose smiles for ever fade so soon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should waste such smiles in vain.<br /></span>

<h4>ADVERTISEMENT.</h4>

<p>The following Poem is the narrative of one day, the pleasantest of many
pleasant ones, of a little Angling-excursion made three summers ago among
the mountains of Westmoreland, Lancashire, and Cumberland. A tent, large
panniers filled with its furniture, with provisions, &amp;c. were loaded upon
horses, and while the anglers, who separated every morning, pursued each
his own sport up the torrents, were carried over the mountains to the
appointed place by some lake or stream, where they were to meet again in
the evening.</p>

<p>In this manner they visited all the wildest and most secluded scenes of the
country. On the first Sunday they passed among the hills, their tent was
pitched on the banks of Wast-Water, at the head of that wild and solitary
lake, which they had reached by the mountain-path that passes Barn-Moor
Tarn from Eskdale. Towards evening the inhabitants of the valley, not
exceeding half a dozen families, with some too from the neighbouring glens,
drawn by the unusual appearance, came to visit the strangers in their tent.
Without, the evening was calm and beautiful; within, were the gaiety and
kindness of simple mirth. At a late hour, their guests departed under a
most refulgent moon that lighted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span> them up the surrounding mountains, on
which they turned to hail with long-continued shouts and songs the blazing
of a huge fire, that was hastily kindled at the door of the tent to bid
them a distant farewell.</p>

<p>The images and feelings of these few happy days, and above all, of that
delightful evening, the author wished to preserve in poetry. What he has
written, while it serves to himself and his friends as a record of past
happiness, may, he hopes, without impropriety be offered to the public,
since, if at all faithful to its subject, it will have some interest to
those who delight in the wilder scenes of Nature, and who have studied with
respect and love the character of their simple inhabitants.</p>

<span class="i0">Then did we learn that this our stranger tent,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Close to their husbands' or their children's side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A neighbour's friendly greeting interchanged,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Viewing the speaker with a solemn face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While round our feet the playful children stirr'd,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Listening with looks where wonder breathed a glowing grace.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To touch the tempting treasures where they lay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What rapture glistened in their eager eyes,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To use with caution for the strangers' sake!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The unlook'd-for gift we graciously bestow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sudden joy the leaping heart o'erpowers;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Our fairy palace's enchanted ground,<br /></span>

<h2>THE HERMITAGE.</h2>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Stranger! this lonely glen in ancient times<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was named the glen of blood; nor Christian feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By night or day, from these o'er-arching cliffs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That haply now have to thy joyful shouts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Return'd a mellow music, ever brought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One trembling sound to break the depth of silence.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The village maiden, in this little stream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though then, as now, most clearly beautiful,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ne'er steeped her simple garments, while she sang<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some native air of sadness or of mirth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In these cold, shady pools, the fearless trout<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ne'er saw the shadow, but of sailing cloud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or kite that wheeling eyed the far-off lamb;<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And on yon hazel bowers the ripen'd fruit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hung clustering, moved but by the frequent swing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of playful squirrel,&mdash;for no school-boy here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With crook and angle light on holiday<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came nutting, or to snare the sportive fry.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even bolder spirits shunn'd the glen of blood!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These rocks, the abode of echo, never mock'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sportive din the huntsman's bugle horn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as the shepherd from the mountain-fold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Homewards return'd beneath the silent Moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A low unconscious prayer would agitate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His breathless heart, for here in unblest grave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay one for whom ne'er toll'd the passing-bell!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And thus was Nature by the impious guilt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of one who scorn'd her gracious solitude,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Defrauded of her worshippers: though pure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This glen, as consecrated house of God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fit haunt of heaven-aspiring piety,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or in whose dripping cells the poet's ear<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Might list unearthly music, this sweet glen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all its tender tints and pensive sounds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its balmy fragrance and romantic forms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay lonely and unvisited, yea worse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Peopled with fancied demons, and the brood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At enmity with man.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i26">So was it once:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now far other creed hath sanctified<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This dim seclusion, and all human hearts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unto its spirit deeply reconciled.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis said, and I in truth believe the tale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That many years ago an aged man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a divine aspect and stately form,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came to this glen, and took up his abode<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In one of those wild caves so numerous<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among the hanging cliffs, though hid from view<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By trailing ivy, or thick holly-bush,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the whole year so deeply, brightly green.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With evil eye the simple villagers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First look'd on him, and scarcely dared to tell<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Each other, what dim fears were in their souls.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But there is something in the voice and eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of beautiful old age, with angel power<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That charms away suspicion, and compels<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The unwilling soul to reverence and love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So was it with this mystical old man!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When first he came into the glen, the spring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had just begun to tinge the sullen rocks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With transient smiles, and ere the leafy bowers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of summer rustled, many a visitant<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had sat within his hospitable cave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From his maple bowl the unpolluted spring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drunk fearless, and with him partook the bread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That his pale lips most reverently had bless'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With words becoming such a holy man!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Oft was he seen surrounded by a groupe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of happy children, unto whom he spake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With more than a paternal tenderness;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they who once had gazed with trembling fear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the wild dweller in th' unholy glen,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
<span class="i0">At last with airy trip and gladsome song<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would seek him there, and listen on his knee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To mournful ditties, and most touching tales!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">One only book was in this hermit's cell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Book of Life; and when from it he read<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With solemn voice devoutly musical,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His thoughtful eye still brightening as the words,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The words of Jesus, in that peaceful cave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sounded more holily,&mdash;and his grey hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Betokening that e'er long in Jesus' breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would be his blessed sleep,&mdash;on his calm brows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spread quietly, like thin and snowy clouds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the husht evening sky:&mdash;While thus he sate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ev'n like the Apostle whom our Saviour loved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In his old age, in Patmos' lonely isle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Musing on him that he had served in youth,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! then, I ween, the awe-struck villagers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could scarce sustain his tones so deeply charged<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With hope, and faith, and gratitude, and joy.<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But when they gazed!&mdash;in the mild lineaments<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of his majestic visage, they beheld<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How beautiful is holiness, and deem'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sure he was some spirit sent by God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To teach the way to Heaven!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i26">And yet his voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was oft times sadder, than as they conceived<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An Angel's voice would be, and though to sooth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sorrows of all others ever seem'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His only end in life, perhaps he had<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Griefs of his own of which he nothing spake;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Else were his locks more grey, more pale his cheek,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than one had thought who only saw his form<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So stately and so tall.&mdash;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i26">Once did they speak<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To him of that most miserable man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who here himself had slain,&mdash;and then his eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was glazed with stern compassion, and a tear,&mdash;<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
<span class="i0">It was the first they e'er had seen him shed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though mercy was the attribute he loved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dearest in God's own Son,&mdash;bedimm'd its light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For a short moment; yea, that hermit old<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wept,&mdash;and his sadden'd face angelical<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Veil'd with his wither'd hands,&mdash;then on their knees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He bade his children (so he loved to call<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The villagers) kneel down; and unto God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pray for his brother's soul.&mdash;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i26">Amid the dust<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hermit long hath slept,&mdash;and every one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That listen'd to the saint's delightful voice.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In yonder church-yard, near the eastern porch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Close to the altar-wall, a little mound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if by nature shaped, and strewn by her<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With every tender flower that sorrow loves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tradition calls his grave. On Sabbath-day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hind oft hears the legendary tale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rehearsed by village moralist austere<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With many a pious phrase; and not a child,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Whose trembling feet have scarcely learnt to walk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But will conduct thee to the hallow'd spot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lisp the hermit's name.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i26">Nor did the cave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he long time from Nature tenanted<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remain unhonour'd.&mdash;Duly every spring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the day he died, thither repair'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Many a pure spirit, to his memory<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chaunting a choral hymn, composed by one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who on his death-bed sat and closed his eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I am the resurrection and the life,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some old man then would, with a solemn voice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Read from that Bible that so oft had blest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Hermit's solitude with heavenly chear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This Book, sole relic of the sinless man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was from the dust kept sacred, and even now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lies in yon box of undecaying yew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And may it never fade!&mdash;<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>

<span class="i26">Stranger unknown!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Like a long wish'd-for slumber. The great Lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose castle stands amid the music wild<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Breathed from the bosom of an hundred glens,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In youth by nature taught to venerate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Things truly venerable, hither came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One year to view the fair solemnity:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The entrance of the cave, or worm defile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The soft green beauty of its mossy walls,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Whose heart doth love in silent communings<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Peace to the dead! the voice of Nature cries,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even o'er the grave where guilt or frailty lies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Compassion drives each sterner thought away,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The solemn sabbath brooding o'er the tomb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The holy stillness that suspends our breath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the soul rests within the shade of death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What heart could then with-hold the pensive sigh<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The headstrong will with innocence at strife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The restless passions that deform'd his life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Desires that spurn'd at reason's weak controul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dimm'd the native lustre of the soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The look repulsive that like ice repress'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The friendly warmth that play'd within the breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The slighting word, through heedlessness severe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wounding the spirit that it ought to chear,<br /></span>

<h2>HYMN TO SPRING</h2>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">How beautiful the pastime of the Spring!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo! newly waking from her wintry dream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She, like a smiling infant, timid plays<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the green margin of this sunny lake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fearing, by starts, the little breaking waves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(If riplings rather known by sound than sight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May haply so be named) that in the grass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soon fade in murmuring mirth; now seeming proud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To venture round the edge of yon far point,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That from an eminence softly sinking down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doth from the wide and homeless waters shape<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A scene of tender, delicate repose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fit haunt for thee, in thy first hours of joy,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Delightful Spring!&mdash;nor less an emblem fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like thee, of beauty, innocence, and youth.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">On such a day, 'mid such a scene as this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Methinks the poets who in lovely hymns<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have sung thy reign, sweet Power, and wished it long,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In their warm hearts conceived those eulogies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, lending to the world inanimate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A pulse and spirit of life, for aye preserve<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sanctity of Nature, and embalm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her fleeting spectacles in memory's cell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In spite of time's mutations. Onwards roll<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The circling seasons, and as each gives birth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To dreams peculiar, yea destructive oft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of former feelings, in oblivion's shade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sleep the fair visions of forgotten hours.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Nature calls the poet to her aid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in his lays beholds her glory live<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For ever. Thus, in winter's deepest gloom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When all is dim before the outward eye,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Nor the ear catches one delightful sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They who have wander'd in their musing walks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the great poets, in their spirits feel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No change on earth, but see the unalter'd woods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laden with beauty, and inhale the song<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of birds, airs, echoes, and of vernal showers.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">So hath it been with me, delightful Spring!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now I hail thee as a friend who pays<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An annual visit, yet whose image lives<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From parting to return, and who is blest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each time with blessings warmer than before.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Oh! gracious Power! for thy beloved approach<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The expecting earth lay wrapt in kindling smiles,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Struggling with tears, and often overcome.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A blessing sent before thee from the heavens,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A balmy spirit breathing tenderness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prepared thy way, and all created things<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Felt that the angel of delight was near.<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Thou camest at last, and such a heavenly smile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shone round thee, as beseem'd the eldest-born<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Nature's guardian spirits. The great Sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scattering the clouds with a resistless smile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came forth to do thee homage; a sweet hymn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was by the low Winds chaunted in the sky;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when thy feet descended on the earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scarce could they move amid the clustering flowers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Nature strewn o'er valley, hill, and field,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hail her blest deliverer!&mdash;Ye fair Trees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How are ye changed, and changing while I gaze!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It seems as if some gleam of verdant light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fell on you from a rainbow; but it lives<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid your tendrils, brightening every hour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into a deeper radiance. Ye sweet Birds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were you asleep through all the wintry hours,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath the waters, or in mossy caves?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There are, 'tis said, birds that pursue the spring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where'er she flies, or else in death-like sleep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Abide her annual reign, when forth they come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With freshen'd plumage and enraptured song,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
<span class="i0">As ye do now, unwearied choristers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the land ring with joy. Yet are ye not,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sporting in tree and air, more beautiful<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than the young lambs, that from the valley-side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Send a soft bleating like an infant's voice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Half happy, half afraid! O blessed things!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At sight of this your perfect innocence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sterner thoughts of manhood melt away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into a mood as mild as woman's dreams.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The strife of working intellect, the stir<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of hopes ambitious; the disturbing sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of fame, and all that worshipp'd pageantry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That ardent spirits burn, for in their pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fly like disparting clouds, and leave the soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pure and serene as the blue depths of heaven.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Now, is the time in some meek solitude<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hold communion with those innocent thoughts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That bless'd our earlier days;&mdash;to list the voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Conscience murmuring from her inmost shrine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And learn if still she sing the quiet tune<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
<span class="i0">That fill'd the ear of youth. If then we feel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That 'mid the powers, the passions, and desires<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of riper age, we still have kept our hearts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Free from pollution, and 'mid tempting scenes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Walk'd on with pure and unreproved steps,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fearless of guilt, as if we knew it not;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah me! with what a new sublimity<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will the green hills lift up their sunny heads,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ourselves as stately: Smiling will we gaze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the clouds whose happy home is in the heavens;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor envy the clear streamlet that pursues<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His course 'mid flowers and music to the sea.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But dread the beauty of a vernal day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou trembler before memory! To the saint<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What sight so lovely as the angel form<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That smiles upon his sleep! The sinner veils<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His face ashamed,&mdash;unable to endure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The upbraiding silence of the seraph's eyes!&mdash;<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Yet awful must it be, even to the best<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wisest man, when he beholds the sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prepared once more to run his annual round<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of glory and of love, and thinks that God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To him, though sojourning in earthly shades,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath also given an orbit, whence his light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May glad the nations, or at least diffuse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Peace and contentment over those he loves!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His soul expanded by the breath of Spring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With holy confidence the thoughtful man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Renews his vows to virtue,&mdash;vows that bind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To purest motives and most useful deeds.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus solemnly doth pass the vernal day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In abstinence severe from worldly thoughts;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lofty disdainings of all trivial joys<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or sorrows; meditations long and deep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On objects fit for the immortal love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of souls immortal; weeping penitence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For duties (plain though highest duties be)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Despised or violated; humblest vows,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Though humble strong as death, henceforth to walk<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Elate in innocence; and, holier still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Warm gushings of his spirit unto God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For all his past existence, whether bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the spring landscape sleeping in the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or dim and desolate like a wintry sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stormy and boding storms! Oh! such will be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Frequent and long his musings, till he feels<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As all the stir subsides, like busy day<br /></span>

<span class="i0">How blest is peace when born within the soul.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">And therefore do I sing these pensive hymns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O Spring! to thee, though thou by some art call'd<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With festive dances and a choral song.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No melancholy man am I, sweet Spring!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, filling all things with his own poor griefs,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Yet knowing something, dimly though it be,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And most tumultuous thing, the heart of man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It chanceth oft, that mix'd with Nature's smiles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My soul beholds a solemn quietness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That almost looks like grief, as if on earth<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Sports round me, and all images of peace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seem native to this earth, nor other home<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Desire or know. Yet doth a mystic chain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Link in our hearts foreboding fears of death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With every loveliest thing that seems to us<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Most deeply fraught with life. Is there a child<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More beauteous than its playmates, even more pure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than they? while gazing on its face, we think<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That one so fair most surely soon will die!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such are the fears now beating at my heart.<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Ere long, sweet Spring! amid forgotten things<br /></span>

<span class="i0">My soul, behold the beauty of his home!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The very heavens look down with gracious smiles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon its holy rest. How bright a green<br /></span>

<span class="i0">They speak: a soft, subduing tenderness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Born of devotion, innocence and bliss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Steals from their bosoms in a silver voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That makes a pious hymning melody.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They look: a gleam of light as sadly sweet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if they listen'd to some mournful tale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swims in their eyes that almost melt to tears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They smile: oh! never did such languor steal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From lustre of two early-risen stars<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When all the silent heavens appear their own.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lo! an infant shews his gladsome face!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His beautiful and shining golden head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lies on his mother's bosom, like a rose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fallen on a lilied bank. A dewy light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meets the soft smiling of his upward eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As in the playful restlessness of joy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He clings around her neck, and fondly strives<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To reach the kisses mantling from her soul.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;And now, the baby in his cradle sleeps,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hush'd by his mother's prayer! How soft her tread<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Dreams of sweet looks of waking happiness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unceasing greetings of congenial thought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep blendings of existence; till awoke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the long stirring of delightful dreams,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The hallow'd porch. She hath a heavenly smile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sinks into the sullen soul of vice,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And makes him turn an eye of kindliness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even on the blessings that he came to blast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is a lofty thought, O guardian love!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To think that he who lives beneath thine eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can never be polluted. Pestilence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dire, contagious pestilence of sin<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Unharm'd, as Israel's heaven-protected sons,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the exterminating angel pass'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With steps of blood o'er Egypt's groaning land.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then ever keep unbroken and unstained<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sabbath-sanctity of home; the shrine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where spirit in its rapture worships God.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Heaven beloved for ever are the walls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That duly every morn and evening hear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our whisper'd hymns! Eternity broods there.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Albeit quaint, and with no nice regard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To highest rules of grace and symmetry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Plaything of art, it venture thus to stand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Mid the great forms of Nature. Doth it seem<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A vain intruder in the quiet heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of this majestic Lake, that like an arm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Ocean, or some Indian river vast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In beauty floats amid its guardian hills?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Haply it may: yet in this humble tower,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mimicry of loftier edifice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There lives a silent spirit, that confers<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
<span class="i0">A lasting charter on its sportive wreath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of battlements, amid the mountain-calm<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That with his shadow dims the dazzling lake!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Then blame it not: for know 'twas planted here,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">By one<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> who meant to Nature's sanctity<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No cold unmeaning outrage. He was one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who often in adventurous youth had sail'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er the great waters, and he dearly loved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their music wild; nor less the gallant souls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose home is on the Ocean:&mdash;so he framed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This jutting mole, that like a natural cape<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meets the soft-breaking waves, and on its point,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bethinking him of some sea-structure huge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Watch-tower or light-house, rear'd this mimic dome,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seen up and down the lake, a monument<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Whom death has made immortal.&mdash;Not misplaced<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On temple rising from an inland sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such venerable names, though ne'er was heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sound of cannon o'er these tranquil shores,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save when it peal'd to waken in her cave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mountain echo: yet this chronicle,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Following the plough along these fertile vales,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or up among the misty solitude<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To break the line of battle, meteor-like<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long ensigns brightening on the towery mast,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Lowering like thunder-clouds!&mdash;<br /></span>

<h2>PICTURE OF A BLIND MAN.</h2>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Why sits so long beside you cottage-door<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That aged man with tresses thin and hoar?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fix'd are his eyes in one continued gaze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor seem to feel the sun's meridian blaze;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet are the orbs with youth-like colours bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As o'er the Iris falls the trembling light.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Changeless his mien; not even one flitting trace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of spirit wanders o'er his furrow'd face;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No feeling moves his venerable head:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;He sitteth there&mdash;an emblem of the dead!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The staff of age lies near him on the seat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His faithful dog is slumbering at his feet,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>

<span class="i0">While thus her father rests upon his way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her sport will leave, nor cast one look behind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soon as she hears his voice,&mdash;for he is blind!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">He speaks by name to the delighted child!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, bending mute in dreams of painful bliss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Breathes o'er her neck a father's tenderest kiss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with light hand upon her forehead fair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smooths the stray ringlets of her silky hair!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A beauteous phantom rises through the night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For ever brooding o'er his darken'd sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So clearly imaged both in form and limb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He scarce remembers that his eyes are dim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But thinks he sees in truth the vernal wreath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His gentle infant wove, that it might breathe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sweet restoring fragrance through his breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chosen from the wild-flowers that he loves the best.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In that sweet trance he sees the sparkling glee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sanctifies the face of infancy;<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The dimpled cheek where playful fondness lies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the blue softness of her smiling eyes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spirit's temple unprofaned by tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where God's unclouded loveliness appears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those gleams of soul to every feature given,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When youth walks guiltless by the light of heaven!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">And oh! what pleasures through his spirit burn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When to the gate his homeward steps return;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When fancy's eye the curling smoke surveys,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his own hearth is gaily heard to blaze!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How beams his sightless visage! when the press<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Love's known hand, with cheerful tenderness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Falls on his arm, and leads with guardian care<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His helpless footsteps to the accustomed chair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When that dear voice he joy'd from youth to hear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With kind enquiry comes unto his ear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tremulous tells how lovely still must be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those fading beauties that he ne'er must see!<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>

<span class="i0">To him be known but by its murmuring;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the long leaf that trembles in the breeze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be all that tells him of his native trees;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet dear to him each viewless object round<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Familiar to his soul from touch or sound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stream, 'mid banks of osier winding near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lulls his calm spirit through the listening ear:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deeply his soul enjoys the loving strife<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the warm summer air is fill'd with life;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as his limbs in quiet dreams are laid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blest is the oak's contemporary shade.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Lakes of blue mist, where gleam'd the whitening sail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many a woodland interposing vale.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Thou seest them still: and oh! how soft a shade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Does memory breathe o'er mountain, wood, and glade!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each craggy pass, where oft in sportive scorn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had sprung thy limbs in life's exulting morn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each misty cataract, and torrent-flood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where thou a silent angler oft hast stood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each shelter'd creek where through the roughest day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Floated thy bark without the anchor's stay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each nameless field by nameless thought endear'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each little hedge-row that thy childhood rear'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That seems unalter'd yet in form and size,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though fled the clouds of fifty summer skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rise on thy soul,&mdash;on high devotion springs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through Nature's beauty borne on Fancy's wings,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>

<h2>TROUTBECK CHAPEL.</h2>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">How sweet and solemn at the close of day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After a long and lonely pilgrimage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among the mountains, where our spirits held<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With wildering fancy and her kindred powers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High converse, to descend as from the clouds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into a quiet valley, fill'd with trees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Nature planted, crowding round the brink<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of an oft-hidden rivulet, or hung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A beauteous shelter o'er the humble roof<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of many a moss-grown cottage!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i36">In that hour<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Where nought may break the solemn images<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The bed of rest, where with their fathers sleep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The children of the vale, and the calm stream<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For ever, by the mystic power of sound<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>

<span class="i0">By sounding waterfall, that 'mid the calm<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Walk'd on encircled by green pastoral hills.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before me suddenly thy chapel rose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if it were an image: even then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The noise of thunder roll'd along the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And darkness veil'd the heights,&mdash;a summer-storm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of short forewarning and of transient power.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah me! how beautifully silent thou<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>

<span class="i0">A holy shelter to thee in the storm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And made thee shine amid the brooding gloom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bright as the morning star. Between the fits<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the loud thunder, rose the voice of Psalms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A most soul-moving sound. There unappall'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A choir of youths and maidens hymned their God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With tones that robb'd the thunder of its dread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bidding it rave in vain.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Chaunting to heaven the hymn of gratitude.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The service closed; and o'er the church-yard spread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The happy flock who in that peaceful fold<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The comfort of a faith that cannot die,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>

<span class="i0">A throne in heaven, by power of heavenly acts,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Against the fierce array of bloody men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Avarice and ignorance, cruelty and hate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A holy warfare! Deep within his soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The groans of anguish, and the clank of chains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dwelt ceaseless as a cataract, and fill'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The secret haunts of meditative prayer.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Encircled by the silence of the hearth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The evening-silence of a happy home;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon his midnight bed, when working soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turns inward, and the steady flow of thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is all we feel of life; in crowded rooms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where mere sensation oft takes place of mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all time seems the present; in the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The joyful splendour of a summer-day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or 'neath the moon, the calm and gentle night;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where'er he moved, one vision ever fill'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His restless spirit. 'Twas a vision bright<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With colours born in Heaven, yet oh! bedimm'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With breath of sorrow, sighs, and tears, and blood!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before him lay a quarter of the world,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
<span class="i0">A Mighty Land, wash'd by unnumber'd floods,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Roll ocean-like, or in the central wilds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fade like the dim day melting into night;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A land all teeming with the gorgeous shew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Nature in profuse magnificence!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vallies and groves, where untamed herds have ranged<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without a master since the birth of time!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fountains and caves fill'd with the hidden light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of diamond and of ruby, only view'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With admiration by the unenvying sun!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Millions of beings like himself he sees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In stature and in soul,&mdash;the sons of God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Destined to do him homage, and to lift<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their fearless brows unto the burning sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stamp'd with his holy image! Noble shapes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kings of the desert, men whose stately tread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brings from the dust the sound of liberty!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The vision fades not here; he sees the gloom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That lies upon these kingdoms of the sun,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And makes them darker than the dreary realms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scarce-moving at the pole.&mdash;A sluggish flow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Attends those floods so great and beautiful,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rolling in majesty that none adores!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lo! the faces of those stately men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Silent as death, or changed to ghastly shapes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By madness and despair! His ears are torn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By shrieks and ravings, loud, and long, and wild,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or the deep-mutter'd curse of sullen hearts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scorning in bitter woe their gnawing chains!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sees, and shuddering feels the vision true,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A pale-faced band, who in his mother-isle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First look'd upon the day, beneath its light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dare to be tyrants, and with coward deeds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sullying the glory of the Queen of Waves!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sees that famous Isle, whose very winds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dissolve like icicles the tyrant's chains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Afric bind them firm as adamant,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet boast, with false and hollow gratitude,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That she alone is free! The awful sight<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Appals not him; he draws his lonely breath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without a tremor; for a voice is heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Breathed by no human lips,&mdash;heard by his soul,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he by Heaven is chosen to restore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mercy on earth, a mighty conqueror<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the sins and miseries of man.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The work is done! the Niger's sullen waves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have heard the tidings,&mdash;and the orient Sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beholds them rolling on to meet his light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In joyful beauty.&mdash;Tomb&ucirc;t's spiry towers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are bright without the brightness of the day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Houssa wakening from his age-long trance<br /></span>

<p><i>Two Editions of this little Poem have been already published; and its
reception among those whom the author most wished to please, has induced

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With tearless eyes and undisturbed heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O Bard! of sinless life and holiest song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I muse upon thy death-bed and thy grave;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though round that grave the trodden grass still lies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Besmeared with clay; for many feet were there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fast-rooted to the spot, when slowly sank<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy coffin, <span class="smcap">Grahame</span>! into the quiet cell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, well I loved thee, even as one might love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An elder brother, imaged in the soul<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
<span class="i0">With solemn features, half-creating awe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But smiling still with gentleness and peace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tears have I shed when thy most mournful voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did tremblingly breathe forth that touching air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Scottish shepherd haply framed of old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid the silence of his pastoral hills,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Weeping the flowers on Flodden-field that died.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wept, too, have I, when thou didst simply read<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From thine own lays so simply beautiful<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some short pathetic tale of human grief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or orison or hymn of deeper love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That might have won the sceptic's sullen heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To gradual adoration, and belief<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Him who died for us upon the cross.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea! oft when thou wert well, and in the calm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of thy most Christian spirit blessing all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who look'd upon thee, with those gentlest smiles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That never lay on human face but thine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even when thy serious eyes were lighted up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With kindling mirth, and from thy lips distill'd<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Words soft as dew, and cheerful as the dawn,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Eye, voice, and smile, nor less thy bending frame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By other cause impair'd than length of years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay something that still turn'd the thoughtful heart<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Tears could I give thee, when thou wert alive,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mournful tears of deep foreboding love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That might not be restrain'd; but now they seem<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Most idle all! thy worldly course is o'er,<br /></span>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
